# TaskWindow

The Eisenhower Matrix is a tool for task management in a productive way [1], 
the level of importance and the level of urgency are the 2 dimensions of the matrix,
therefore the 4 quadrants represent 4 types of tasks respectively. Read the reference 
for more info about how to manange tasks with the matrix.

This project is the application implementation of the task management tool, where tasks are represented 
by notes in the user interface.
